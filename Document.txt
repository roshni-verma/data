1.What is the average flood probability across different regions?
2What are the most common values for factors like "Monsoon Intensity," "Deforestation," and "Urbanization"?
3.Is there a strong correlation between "Monsoon Intensity" and "Flood Probability"?
4.How do different factors like "Urbanization" and "Deforestation" impact "Flood Probability"?
5.What is the impact of "Climate Change" on "Flood Probability" compared to "Urbanization"?
6.Can we predict "Flood Probability" based on the combination of factors like "Monsoon Intensity," "Siltation," and "Drainage Systems"?
7.Which factors are the most significant predictors of flood probability?
8.Does increased "Deforestation" lead to higher flood probability?
9.How does improving "Dams Quality" affect flood probability over time?
10.Are there any missing values in the dataset that need to be handled before analysis?
11.How should the dataset be preprocessed (e.g., normalization, scaling) for better analysis?
Are there any redundant features that could be removed to simplify the model?
